###POSTMAN COLLECTION EXTRACTOR

*_Purpose:_* 
- To be able to take a postman collection with a full folder of testing and extract only the usable tests to be able to be ran in a continuous integration environment. This will extract the tests from a postman collection but also put it back together to be able to be re used in postman. This allows you to run the test in javascript using Newman!
